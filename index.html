<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>I am currently interested in the sports marketing industry. I'm majoring in Marketing with a minor in Sports Media, and I might want to pursue a Master's degree in Sports Management after undergrad. My dream job would be to work in the marketing or sponsorship department for a professional sports team.<br /><br /></p>
